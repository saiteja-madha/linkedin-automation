# LinkedIn Automation

LinkedIn Automation is a project that utilizes [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to automate job application process on LinkedIn. This project is currently a work in progress, but it provides a basic idea of what the final product will look like.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have [Python 3](hhttps://www.python.org/) installed on your system. Once Python is installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cd linkedin-automation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/linkedin.py
```

Before running the app, make sure to fill in the necessary details in the `config.yaml` file. Some of the fields are already filled, but you will need to fill in the following fields:

- email - Your LinkedIn email address
- password - Your LinkedIn password
